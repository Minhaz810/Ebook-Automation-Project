# You can Download the fine tuned model from
[Fine Tuned Bengali Model](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18bcgJ-0ZbYPkfgCX8w-ogDieDNnvXgni?usp=drive_link)

Please Make a folder with the name 'fine_tuned_bengali_model' and keep the 6 files there after downloading, otherwise you need to edit the code with the files location.Also Keep the ipnyb files in the same location where you have your 'fine_tuned_bengali_model' folder

# Challenges

## 1. Handling Mixed Font Weights in Paragraphs:

When a paragraph contains multiple font weights (e.g., bold, italic, regular), the system currently normalizes all text to a single font weight due to technical limitations in the text extraction process.

## 2. Table and Image Processing:

The project does not currently support table or image extraction and processing due to time constraints. Future iterations aim to include this feature.

## 3. Limited Training Data:

The model has been trained on a limited dataset, which can occasionally lead to inaccurate predictions or classifications.

## 4. Language Support:

The model is optimized for Bengali text classification. Additional training is required to extend its capabilities to English or other languages.

# Future Plans

1. Improve the handling of mixed font weights within a single paragraph.

2. Add support for processing and digitizing tables.

3. Train the model with a larger and more diverse dataset to improve accuracy.

4. Expand language support to include English and other widely-used languages.
